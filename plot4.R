# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

## Determine EI Sectors that refer to coal and related sub-levels of the SCC hierarchy
## Assuming SCC is constructed as a multi-level hierararchy of nodes where the top node
## has a direct relation with the underlying nodes.
## The three EI.Sector's of interest are:
## 1. "Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal" 
## 2. "Fuel Comb - Industrial Boilers, ICEs - Coal"
## 3. "Fuel Comb - Comm/Institutional - Coal"
